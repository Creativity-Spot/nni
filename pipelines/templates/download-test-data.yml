# The test data should be uploaded to:
#   https://nni.blob.core.windows.net/testdata/mnist.zip
#   https://nni.blob.core.windows.net/testdata/cifar10.zip
#   ...
#
# We can't upload the data regularly on pipelines,
# because it's not easy to setup auto-download for some datasets.
# See cache-dependencies-template.yml on how to generate credentials to upload new test data.
